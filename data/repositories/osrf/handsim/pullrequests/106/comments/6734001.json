If you pause mo-cap, move OptiTrack, and then unpause mo-cap, it looks OK. We agreed to fix this issue in the future as it doesn't seem a situation that teams will do.\n* Camera view changes if you toggle the `Enable viewpoint rotations` button without pause mo-cap. Fixed by @hsu.\n* There's still a small vibration in the viewpoint. We have concludes that this is caused by camera calibration due to lightining conditions during testing.\n\nOther than that, it looks good to me. Good job!", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>I've been testing the pull request and found the following issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The camera view moves if you move the OptiTrack camera in play mo-cap mode.
