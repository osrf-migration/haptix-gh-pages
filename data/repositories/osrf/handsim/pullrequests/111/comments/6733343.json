The test verifies that it receives the correct forces for the next 3 seconds (full force, half force, then no force).\n\nI didn't see any difference between assigning the iter to the return value of `erase` vs. not. I think this is because when `erase` is called, the vector container moves all the elements up to fill the place of the erased item, and when `erase` is called on the last element, the for loop exits before we dereference the vector `end`.\n\nStill, I'll change it to be safe.\n\t\n5c2902b\n \n4212418", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>The test case I used was the MultipleForces test case in the sim_api test.
