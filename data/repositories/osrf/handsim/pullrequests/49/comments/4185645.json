However, handsim-proprietary is also a catkin package, which makes it convenient to build both handsim and handsim-proprietary using catkin. It appears to me that on this branch, in order to install handsim from source, you still have to catkin_make handsim-proprietary (which is now in its own catkin workspace, since handsim is no longer catkin) and source the install files in the catkin workspace, creating an extra step for the user. Are you planning on migrating handsim-proprietary to a default CMake build as well, and including it in handsim using cmake? Or should I just suck it up and write a script for myself to source all the necessary files?", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>wow, nice refactoring!
