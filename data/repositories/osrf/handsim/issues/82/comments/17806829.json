For example, we want to see if a user can tell if an object in the environment is lightweight or heavy.

Since we as the experimenters know the weight we assigned, we can assign correct or incorrect to each trial. A statistically significant correct/incorrect rate would tell us if we can use our neural interface to allow a prosthesis user to tell the weight of an object. It would be nice if we did not have to reload the simulation for every trial to change the objects weight. If we could change the object's weight mid simulation, then we could run trials very quickly.
