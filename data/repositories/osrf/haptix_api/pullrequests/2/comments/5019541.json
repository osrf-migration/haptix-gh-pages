The timestamp field is not currently implemented, which is why we haven't ironed out these details yet. Let's resolve that now.\n\nIf we go with relative time, it would make sense to make the reference point be the time when the simulator/device starts up, or when the simulator/device/hxserver and the hxclient first connect. The choice is somewhat arbitrary, because in most cases the timestamp will be used to judge the relative age of messages, and the reference point doesn't really matter. I think I like absolute time better, because the user can then choose the reference point, and it also simplifies the implementation detail of tracking the timestamp. The only issue with using EPOCH, however, is that I believe it is UNIX-specific, and this API must support Windows machines. Can we resolve this in the implementation of haptix-comm, or will this be an issue in cross-platform communication?", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Great point.
