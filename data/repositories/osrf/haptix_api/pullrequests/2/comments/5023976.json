Since we are finalizing API 1.0 now, lets leave orientation out and add it later if we get confirmation that it is provided by the hardware.\n\nWe still need to design a future world API btw, and it will most likely provide the positions and orientations of all bodies, including the IMUs. But in that case it will be clearly labeled as a debugging aid.\n\nOn a related note:  do you have an analytical solution for the IMU output or is it based on finite-differencing?  Mujoco now does all computations in continuous time (no more velocity-stepping solvers!), so the IMUs are modeled analytically.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Right, we need to understand if the hardware provides an orientation estimate or not.
